# Narya

Narya is eventually intended to be a proof assistant implementing Multimodal Parametric/Higher Observational Type Theory.  A formal type theory combining all those adjectives has not yet been specified.  At the moment, it implements a normalization-by-evaluation algorithm and typechecker for an observational-style theory with binary Id/Bridge types, but without Gel/Glue types or transport.  There is also no parser, pretty-printer, or executable yet.
