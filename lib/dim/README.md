# Dimension theory for Narya

This directory contains all definitions and code that depends on the definition of the category of dimensions with faces and degeneracy operators.  As of May 2, this category is the n-ary semicartesian cube category.  But in the future, it will be generalized to allow multiple "directions" of dimension, e.g. for parametricity, univalence, and display, of variable arity.
