(* ******************** Raw (unchecked) terms ******************** *)

(* Raw (unchecked) terms, using intrinsically well-scoped De Bruijn indices, and separated into synthesizing terms and checking terms.  These match the user-facing syntax rather than the internal syntax.  In particular, applications, abstractions, and pi-types are all unary, there is only one universe, and the only operator actions are refl (including Id) and sym. *)

(* A raw De Bruijn index is a well-scoped natural number together with a possible face.  During typechecking we will verify that the face, if given, is applicable to the variable as a "cube variable", and compile the combination into a more strongly well-scoped kind of index. *)

  (* A Let can either synthesize or (sometimes) check.  It synthesizes only if its body also synthesizes, but we wait until typechecking type to look for that, so that if it occurs in a checking context the body can also be checking.  Thus, we make it a "synthesizing term".  The term being bound must also synthesize; the shorthand notation "let x : A := M" is expanded during parsing to "let x := M : A". *)

  (* An Act can also sometimes check, if its body checks and the degeneracy is a pure permutation.  But otherwise, it synthesizes and so must its body.  *)

"Nondep" means a placeholder return statement like "_ â†¦ _" was given, indicating that a non-dependent matching is intended (to silence hints about fallback from the implicit case). *)

  (* A "Struct" is our current name for both tuples and comatches, which share a lot of their implementation even though they are conceptually and syntactically distinct.  Those with eta=`Eta are tuples, those with eta=`Noeta are comatches.  We index them by a "Field.t option" so as to include any unlabeled fields, with their relative order to the labeled ones. *)

  (* A record type binds its "self" variable namelessly, exposing it to the user by additional variables that are bound locally to its fields.  This can't be "cubeified" as easily, so we have the user specify a list of ordinary variables to be its boundary.  Thus, in practice below 'c must be a number of faces associated to a dimension, but the parser doesn't know the dimension, so it can't ensure that.  The unnamed internal variable is included as the last one. *)

  (* A hole must store the entire "state" from when it was entered, so that the user can later go back and fill it with a term that would have been valid in its original position.  This includes the variables in lexical scope, which are available only during parsing, so we store them here at that point.  During typechecking, when the actual metavariable is created, we save the lexical scope along with its other context and type data.  A hole also stores its source location so that proofgeneral can create an overlay at that place. *)
