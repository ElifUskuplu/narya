This is a static build of the master branch of Narya, an experimental proof assistant for higher-dimensional type theory.


LINUX
=====

The executable 'narya' should run on any Linux machine.  Place it in a directory that is in your PATH.  On some flavors of Linux, the directory `~/bin` is automatically in your path if it exists, so the first thing to try is

  mkdir -p ~/bin
  cp narya ~/bin

Then restart your shell (i.e. terminal or command prompt) and try running 'narya'.  If that doesn't work, try logging out and back in again.  If that still doesn't work, try something like the following:

  echo export PATH="\$HOME/bin:\$PATH" >>~/.bashrc

and then once again restart your shell, or log out and back in again.

To install the recommended ProofGeneral interactive mode, first make sure Emacs is installed.  On many modern distributions you can install Emacs with

  sudo snap install emacs

Then run the supplied shell script 'install-pg.sh' from this directory:

  ./install-pg.sh

If that doesn't work, please report a bug at https://github.com/gwaithimirdain/narya.  In the meantime, you can follow the instructions in the Narya documentation for installing ProofGeneral manually (https://narya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#proofgeneral-emacs-mode).  You will need to repeat this every time Emacs, ProofGeneral, or Narya is updated.  Finally, you can run

  emacs

and create or open a .ny file to start Narya ProofGeneral.


WINDOWS
=======

The easiest way to run Narya on Windows 11 is inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).  First install WSL by opening a command prompt and running

  wsl --install

After this finishes, you may need to reboot your computer and run the same command again in order to install a Linux distribution inside WSL.  Once WSL is installed, you can run

  wsl

to enter a Linux command prompt, and then follow the Linux instructions.  If you downloaded this bundle in Windows, you can navigate to it in WSL using a path like "/mnt/c/Users/YOUR NAME/Downloads".  You can also download it directly from the WSL prompt with

  wget https://gwaithimirdain.github.io/narya/releases/narya-master-static.tar.gz
  tar -xzf narya-master-static.tar.gz
  cd narya-xxxxxxx-YYYYMMDD

(for the appropriate directory name) and then proceed with the above Linux instructions.  Note that when you run Emacs from within WSL, it should automatically pop up as a graphical window.
