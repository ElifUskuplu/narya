This is a static build of the master branch of Narya, an experimental proof assistant for higher-dimensional type theory.

The executable 'narya' should run on any Linux machine.  Place it in a directory that is in your PATH.  On some flavors of Linux, the directory `~/bin` is automatically in your path if it exists, so the first thing to try would be

  mkdir -p ~/bin
  cp narya ~/bin

Then restart your shell (i.e. terminal or command prompt) and try running 'narya'.  If that doesn't work, try logging out and back in again.  If that still doesn't work, try something like the following commands:

  export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
  echo export PATH="\$HOME/bin:\$PATH" >>~/.bashrc

and then once again restart your shell, or log out and back in again.

To install the recommended ProofGeneral interactive mode, first make sure Emacs is installed, and then run the supplied shell script 'install-pg.sh' from this directory:

  ./install-pg.sh

If that doesn't work, please report a bug at https://github.com/gwaithimirdain/narya.  In the meantime, you can follow the instructions in the Narya documentation for installing ProofGeneral manually (https://narya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#proofgeneral-emacs-mode).  You will need to repeat this every time Emacs, ProofGeneral, or Narya is updated.
