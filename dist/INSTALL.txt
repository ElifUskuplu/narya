This is a static build of the master branch of Narya.  The executable 'narya' should run on any Linux machine.  You may want to place it in a 'bin' directory that is in your PATH.

To install the recommended ProofGeneral interactive mode, follow the following steps:

1. Install Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/> and ProofGeneral.  The recommended way to install ProofGeneral is from MELPA <https://melpa.org/> using Emacs' package manager, as described at the ProofGeneral page <https://proofgeneral.github.io/>.

2. Find the ProofGeneral installation directory, which may be something like "$HOME/.emacs.d/elpa/proof-general-XXXXXXXX-XXXX".

3. In this directory, create a subdirectory called "narya" and copy (or, better, symlink) the ".el" files from this directory into that subdirectory.

4. Then edit the file "proof-site.el" in the subdirectory "generic" of the ProofGeneral installation directory and add a line containing

   (narya "Narya" "ny" nil (".nyo"))

   to the list of proof assistants in the definition of the variable "proof-assistant-table-default".

5. If there is a byte-compiled Emacs Lisp file "proof-site.elc" in the "generic" directory, either delete it, or re-create it from your edited "proof-site.el" using "M-x byte-compile-file".

6. Restart Emacs.
